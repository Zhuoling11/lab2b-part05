## ESE5190 LAB 2B Part 5
This part using the code from the lab1 Firely. The QTPY RP2040 was interfaced with the APDS9960 sensor board using the I2C protocol. The oscilloscope is interfaced with a logic analyzer which is connected to the SDA and SCL pins. As the logic analyzer is used the mode of the oscilloscope is set to digital. 
The oscilloscope output is shown in the attached images. SCL conneected to the probe1 and SDA connected to the probe2. From the image, SDA Channel is indicating to start the I2c communication, and after the high voltage, the system start transmitting the data
